AGROTRACK GUIDE: BEANS FARMING (KENYA)

==================================================
SECTION 1: VARIETY SELECTION
==================================================

COMMON VARIETIES IN KENYA:
- Rose Coco (GLP 2): Most popular, matures in 90-100 days
- Canadian Wonder: High yielding, 70-85 days to maturity
- KAT B1: Drought tolerant
- Mwitemania: Local variety, good for Meru region
- Yellow Beans (Soya type): 80-90 days

==================================================
SECTION 2: SOIL & PLANTING
==================================================

SOIL REQUIREMENTS:
- Well-drained loamy soils
- pH: 5.5-6.5
- Avoid waterlogged soils (beans are very sensitive)

PLANTING TIME:
- Long rains: March-April
- Short rains: September-October
- Meru Region: Late March-April, October-November

SPACING:
- Between rows: 45-50cm
- Within rows: 15-20cm
- Planting depth: 3-5cm
- Seed rate: 40-50kg per hectare (16-20kg per acre)

==================================================
SECTION 3: FERTILIZER APPLICATION
==================================================

BASAL FERTILIZER:
- DAP: 50kg per acre at planting
- Alternative: NPK 17:17:17 at same rate
- Beans fix nitrogen, so minimal top dressing needed

FOLIAR FEEDING (Optional):
- Apply foliar fertilizer at flowering stage
- Improves pod formation

==================================================
SECTION 4: PEST & DISEASE MANAGEMENT
==================================================

MAJOR PESTS:
- Bean Fly: Attacks seedlings, causes wilting
  Control: Seed dressing with Imidacloprid
- Aphids: Spread viral diseases
  Control: Spray with Dimethoate
- Pod Borers: Damage developing pods
  Control: Spray with Profenofos when pods form

MAJOR DISEASES:
- Anthracnose: Dark lesions on pods and leaves
  Control: Use certified seed, fungicide spray (Mancozeb)
- Root Rot: Caused by waterlogging
  Control: Improve drainage, avoid over-irrigation
- Angular Leaf Spot: Angular brown lesions
  Control: Copper-based fungicides

==================================================
SECTION 5: HARVESTING & STORAGE
==================================================

HARVEST TIMING:
- Dry beans: When pods are fully dry and rattle (90-100 days)
- Green beans: Pods filled but still green (60-70 days)

DRYING:
- Sun dry to 12-14% moisture
- Store in hermetic bags or airtight containers

EXPECTED YIELD:
- Good management: 8-12 bags per acre (90kg bags)
- Average: 5-8 bags per acre

MARKET PRICE:
- 5,000-8,000 KES per 90kg bag (seasonal variation)

==================================================
SECTION 6: ROTATION BENEFITS
==================================================

NITROGEN FIXATION:
- Beans fix 40-80kg nitrogen per hectare
- Excellent rotation crop before maize
- Improves soil fertility naturally
- Reduces need for nitrogen fertilizers in subsequent maize crop
