AGROTRACK COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE: MAIZE FARMING IN KENYA

==================================================
SECTION 1: SOIL REQUIREMENTS & PREPARATION
==================================================

SOIL TYPE:
- Best Performance: Well-drained, fertile loamy soils
- Acceptable: Sandy loam, clay loam
- Avoid: Waterlogged or compacted soils
- Optimal pH Range: 5.5 to 7.0
- Critical pH Threshold: Below 5.5 (Too acidic - requires treatment)

SOIL TESTING & AMENDMENT:
- Test soil pH before planting season (costs approximately 500-1000 KES per test)
- If pH is below 5.5: Apply agricultural lime at 2 tons/hectare (approximately 800kg per acre)
- Apply lime 3 weeks before planting to allow proper soil reaction
- Cost of lime: Approximately 1,500-2,500 KES per 50kg bag

LAND PREPARATION:
- First plowing: 6-8 weeks before planting (depth: 15-20cm)
- Second plowing: 2-3 weeks before planting
- Make ridges or furrows for proper drainage
- Clear all weeds and crop residues

==================================================

==================================================
SECTION 4: IRRIGATION & WATER MANAGEMENT
==================================================

WATER REQUIREMENTS:
- Critical Stages: Tasseling and grain filling (most sensitive to drought)
- Total Water Needed: 500-800mm throughout growing season
- Critical Period: 2 weeks before and after tasseling

IRRIGATION SCHEDULE (If available):
- Week 1-2: Light irrigation to establish seedlings
- Week 3-6: Moderate irrigation (20-25mm per week)
- Week 7-10: Heavy irrigation (30-40mm per week) - CRITICAL PERIOD
- Week 11-14: Reduce irrigation (15-20mm per week)
- Week 15+: Minimal to no irrigation (grain drying phase)

DRAINAGE:
- Ensure proper drainage channels to prevent waterlogging
- Maize cannot tolerate standing water for more than 48 hours

==================================================
SECTION 5: WEED CONTROL
==================================================

PRE-EMERGENCE HERBICIDES:
- Atrazine: Apply within 3 days after planting
- Rate: 2-3 liters per hectare

==================================================
SECTION 6: PEST MANAGEMENT
==================================================

FALL ARMYWORM (Spodoptera frugiperda):
- MAJOR THREAT in Kenya since 2017
- Symptoms: 
  * Ragged holes in leaves
  * Sawdust-like frass in leaf whorls
  * Caterpillars feeding on young leaves
- Monitoring: Scout fields twice per week from 2 weeks after emergence
- Control Methods:
  * Chemical: Emamectin Benzoate (e.g., Escort 19EC) - 10ml per 20L of water
  * Spray early morning (6-9 AM) or late evening (5-7 PM)
  * Apply directly into the whorl
  * Cost: 350-500 KES per 10ml sachet
  * Repeat every 7-10 days if infestation persists
- Biological: Release Trichogramma wasps (egg parasitoids)
- Cultural: Early planting to avoid peak infestation periods

MAIZE STALK BORER (Busseola fusca):
- Symptoms: Dead heart in young plants, holes in stems
- Control: 
  * Chemical: Lambda-cyhalothrin or Chlorpyrifos
  * Apply when plants are 3-4 weeks old
  * Push-Pull technology (intercropping with Desmodium)

CUTWORMS:
- Symptoms: Cut seedlings at soil level at night
- Control:
  * Soil application of Dursban or Bulldock at planting
  * Manual collection at night

APHIDS:
- Symptoms: Sticky honeydew on leaves, stunted growth
- Vector for Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease
- Control: Spray with Imidacloprid or Dimethoate

==================================================
SECTION 7: DISEASE MANAGEMENT
==================================================

MAIZE LETHAL NECROSIS (MLN):
- CRITICAL DISEASE - Can cause 100% yield loss
- Symptoms:
  * Chlorotic mottling (yellow streaks) on leaves
  * Dead heart in young plants
  * Premature drying and death of plants
- Transmission: Spread by aphids and thrips
- Control Measures:
  * Plant resistant varieties (e.g., KH500-17A, DH04)
  * Control aphid vectors with insecticides
  * Practice crop rotation with non-cereal crops (beans, peas)
  * Remove and destroy infected plants immediately
  * Use certified disease-free seeds
  * Early planting to avoid vector population peaks
- NO CURE: Prevention is critical

GRAY LEAF SPOT (Cercospora zeae-maydis):
- Symptoms: Rectangular gray-brown lesions on leaves
- Favorable Conditions: High humidity, warm temperatures
- Control:
  * Plant resistant varieties
  * Fungicide spray: Mancozeb or Azoxystrobin
  * Crop rotation, proper spacing for air circulation

COMMON RUST (Puccinia sorghi):
- Symptoms: Reddish-brown pustules on leaves
- Control: Usually not economically damaging; resistant varieties available

NORTHERN CORN LEAF BLIGHT:
- Symptoms: Long cigar-shaped lesions on leaves
- Control: Mancozeb fungicide, resistant varieties

==================================================
SECTION 8: HARVESTING & POST-HARVEST
==================================================

HARVEST TIMING:
- Physiological Maturity: 120-140 days after planting (variety dependent)
- Signs of Maturity:
  * Black layer forms at base of kernel (where it attaches to cob)
  * Husks turn brown and dry
  * Moisture content drops to 20-25%
- Optimal Harvest Moisture: Below 18% for safe storage
- Delay Risks: Pest damage, mold development, lodging

HARVESTING METHOD:
- Manual: Break cobs from stalk, remove husks
- Mechanical: Combine harvester (for large farms)

DRYING:
- Target Moisture: 13-15% for safe storage
- Sun Drying: Spread cobs on tarpaulin, turn regularly (7-14 days)
- Mechanical Drying: Faster but more expensive
- Test Moisture: Bite kernel - should be hard and crack cleanly

SHELLING:
- Remove kernels from cob when properly dried
- Shelling Percentage: Expect 75-80% grain from cob weight

STORAGE:
- Store in dry, well-ventilated place
- Use hermetic bags (e.g., PICS bags) to prevent weevil damage
- Traditional: Raised platforms, proper ventilation
- Chemical Protection: Actellic Super dust (1kg per 90kg bag of grain)
- Cost of Actellic: 400-600 KES per 1kg

STORAGE PESTS:
- Maize Weevil: Most common storage pest
- Larger Grain Borer: Can cause 30-70% loss
- Control: Hermetic storage, chemical protectants, proper drying

==================================================
SECTION 10: COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS
==================================================

PROBLEM: Poor Germination
- Causes: Old seed, too deep planting, poor soil moisture
- Solution: Use certified seed, proper depth, ensure adequate moisture

PROBLEM: Stunted Growth / Yellow Leaves
- Causes: Nitrogen deficiency, waterlogging, pests
- Solution: Apply CAN fertilizer, improve drainage, check for pests

PROBLEM: Tasseling but No Cobs
- Causes: Water stress during flowering, high temperatures
- Solution: Ensure irrigation during critical period, plant drought-tolerant varieties

PROBLEM: Empty Cobs / Poor Grain Filling
- Causes: Water stress, fall armyworm damage, late fertilizer application
- Solution: Adequate water during grain filling, pest control, timely top dressing

PROBLEM: Lodging (Plants Falling Over)
- Causes: Stalk borer damage, strong winds, excessive nitrogen
- Solution: Control borers, avoid over-fertilization, plant in rows perpendicular to prevailing winds

==================================================
SECTION 11: CROP ROTATION & INTERCROPPING
==================================================

RECOMMENDED ROTATION:
Year 1: Maize
Year 2: Beans/Peas (legumes fix nitrogen)
Year 3: Maize
Benefits: Breaks pest/disease cycles, improves soil fertility

INTERCROPPING OPTIONS:
- Maize + Beans: Plant beans 2 weeks after maize
- Push-Pull System: Maize + Desmodium (repels borers) + Napier grass border (traps borers)
- Benefits: Additional income, pest management, soil health

==================================================
