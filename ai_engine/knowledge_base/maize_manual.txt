AGROTRACK GUIDE: MAIZE FARMING (KENYA)

1. SOIL REQUIREMENTS
Maize performs best in well-drained, fertile loamy soils.
Optimal pH is 5.5 to 7.0.
If pH is below 5.5 (Acidic), apply agricultural lime (2 tons/ha) 3 weeks before planting.

2. FERTILIZER APPLICATION
- At Planting: Apply DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate) at a rate of 50kg per acre.
- Top Dressing: Apply CAN (Calcium Ammonium Nitrate) when maize is knee-high (approx 4 weeks after germination). Rate: 50kg per acre.

3. DISEASE MANAGEMENT
- Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN): Symptoms include chlorotic mottling of leaves. Control: Practice crop rotation with non-cereal crops like beans.
- Fall Armyworm: Caterpillars that eat leaves and whorls. Control: Spray with Emamectin Benzoate early in the morning.

4. HARVESTING
Harvest when the moisture content drops below 15%.
Signs of maturity: A black layer forms at the base of the kernel.
