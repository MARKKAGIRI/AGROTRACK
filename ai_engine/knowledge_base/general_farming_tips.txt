WEATHER & CLIMATE MONITORING
==================================================

KENYAN RAINFALL PATTERNS:
- Long Rains: March-May (main season)
- Short Rains: October-December (secondary season)
- Dry Seasons: January-February, June-September

WEATHER RESOURCES:
- Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD): www.meteo.go.ke
- County agricultural offices provide localized forecasts
- SMS services: Subscribe to weather alerts

CLIMATE-SMART TIPS:
- Monitor weather forecasts before planting
- Use drought-tolerant varieties during uncertain seasons
- Prepare for delayed or early rains
- Water harvesting for supplemental irrigation

==================================================
SOIL HEALTH MANAGEMENT
==================================================

SOIL TESTING:
- Test soil every 2-3 years
- Available at KALRO, County labs, private labs
- Cost: 500-2,000 KES depending on tests
- Tests include: pH, N, P, K, organic matter

ORGANIC MATTER:
- Apply compost or manure annually
- Improves water retention
- Enhances soil structure
- Provides slow-release nutrients

COVER CROPS:
- Plant legumes during off-season
- Prevents soil erosion
- Adds nitrogen naturally

==================================================
WATER MANAGEMENT
==================================================

IRRIGATION METHODS:
- Drip irrigation: Most efficient (90% efficiency)
- Sprinkler: Good for large areas (70-80% efficiency)
- Furrow: Traditional method (60% efficiency)

WATER HARVESTING:
- Collect rainwater in tanks/ponds
- Use for supplemental irrigation
- Cost-effective for small farms

==================================================
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM)
==================================================

IPM PRINCIPLES:
1. Prevention (crop rotation, sanitation)
2. Monitoring (regular field scouting)
3. Cultural control (resistant varieties, proper spacing)
4. Biological control (beneficial insects)
5. Chemical control (last resort, when threshold reached)

BENEFICIAL INSECTS:
- Ladybugs: Control aphids
- Trichogramma wasps: Control moth eggs
- Lacewings: Generalist predators
